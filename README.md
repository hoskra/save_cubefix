Why are we saving Cubefix? Cubefix has runned away because he followed the smell of a bacon that led him to the Roman teritorium. By the way, everything is a cube in this world.

- Player is playing for one character at a time and he can switch between them.
- There is a synergy if characters are close to each other.
- A following of characters can be turned on.
- There are roman legionaries which can be stunned by player.
- Cubelix is the squishy character. Only him can loose health. Cuberix has to save him.

### Cubelix
- can block enemy attack, but can't attack
- his ability: sees far away
- when potion is active: attack do stun enemy

### Cuberix
- can block enemy attack, but can't attack
- his ability: attack stuns enemy
- when potion is active: breaks walls

### AI - Legionary
- attack Cubelix
- run away from Cuberix

### Obsticle
- Light (wooden) - can break through
- Hard (stone) - can break through only with potion active
